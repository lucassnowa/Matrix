# Matrix
1.    The composition of the development team is Savluk Vadim (timlid), Chistyakov Sergey (software developer), Andrey Pavlov (software developer).
2. The project implemented by our team makes it possible to perform computational operations on matrices. This project is implemented in the Java programming language. For the development of the project was used Lazarus 2.0 development environment.
3. The development and testing of this project was performed on computers with the installed Windows 10 64 bit operating system of the latest build on 12/23/2018. For the development of this project, the programming language Java Version 8 Update 191 was used, as well as the Lazarus 2.0 development environment.
4. To run the project, you need to collect all the files from the three branches (Cod, Andrey, wumyup) located in GitHub, in one local folder. Next, you should run Main.java using the Lazarus program and start the project by clicking on the Build button.
5. A matrix is a mathematical object written in the form of a rectangular table of elements of a ring or field (for example, integers or complex numbers), which is a collection of rows and columns at the intersection of which are its elements. The number of rows and columns of the matrix set the size of the matrix. Although historically considered, for example, triangular matrices, nowadays they speak exclusively of rectangular matrices, since they are the most convenient and common.
For the first time the matrix was mentioned in ancient China, then called the "magic square." The main use of matrices was to solve linear equations. Also, the magic squares were known a little later by the Arab mathematicians, approximately then the principle of the addition of matrices appeared. After the development of the determinant theory at the end of the 17th century, Gabriel Kramer began developing his theory in the 18th century and published the "Cramer Rule" in 1751. Approximately in the same period of time a “Gauss method” appeared. The theory of matrices began its existence in the middle of the XIX century in the works of William Hamilton and Arthur Cayley. The fundamental results in matrix theory belong to Weierstrass, Jordan, Frobenius. The term "matrix" was introduced by James Sylvester in 1850.
Matrices are widely used in mathematics for compact writing of systems of linear algebraic or differential equations. In this case, the number of rows of the matrix corresponds to the number of equations, and the number of columns to the number of unknowns. As a result, the solution of systems of linear equations is reduced to operations on matrices.
Matrices allow the following algebraic operations:
the addition of matrices having the same size;
multiplication of matrices of suitable size (a matrix with n columns can be multiplied from the right by a matrix with n lines);
multiplying a matrix by an element of the main ring or field (i.e., a scalar)
